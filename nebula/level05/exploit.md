# Level05

The `/home/flag05/` home directory contains a folder called `.backup`. Inside is a backup of `flag05`'s home directory, but we are able to decompress it due to incorrect directory permissions. We can decompress the `backup-19072011.tgz` file into our home directory, which will overwrite our `.ssh` keys with `flag05`'s. Then, we can `ssh` into `flag05`'s account and gain access.

```bash
level05@nebula:/home/level05$ tar -xzvf .backup/backup-19072011.tgz -C ~/
level05@nebula:/home/level05$ ssh flag05@nebula
flag05@nebula:~$ getflag
