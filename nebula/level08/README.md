# Level08

This one simply has a `capture.pcap` file in the home directory, which we are able to load up in wireshark. 

![Wireshark](wireshark.png)

It's a TCP session over ports 39247 and 12121. Inspecting the packets reveal packets 20 and 43, which suggest that this is an SSH login session. Note that you can add these ports to the SSH filter to get slightly more descriptive information. Packet 45 and onwards seem to be the user inputting the password, with each character being spread over individual packets. Following the `data` portion (the last byte of each packet in this case) for each packet until we reach bytes `00 0d 0a` should net us the password.

> `00 0d 0a` is a null byte followed by a CRLF line break.

Following the packets gives us the following bytes:

```
62 61 63 6b 64 6f 6f 72 7f  7f  7f  30 30 52 6d 38 7f  61 74 65 00 0d 0a =>
b  a  c  k  d  o  o  r  DEL DEL DEL 0  0  R  m  8  DEL a  t  e  END      =>

backd00Rmate
```

The `7f` bytes present mean the user is pressing backspace, so we delete the previous character. The password ends up being `backd00Rmate`, which we can use to log into `flag08` with `su`:

```bash
level08@nebula:/home/flag08$ su flag08
Password: 
sh-4.2$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
