# Level06

Running `cat /etc/passwd/ | grep flag06` reveals that `flag06`'s password is stored with a legacy method.

```bash
cat /etc/passwd/ | grep flag06
flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:993:993::/home/flag06:/bin/sh
```

Passwords used to be encrypted with `crypt` which implemented a version of DES, using the password as a key to encrypt a bunch of zeroes 25 times. It uses 56-bit keys (7 characters) and 2 characters for the salt, which makes breaking it pretty easy, especially with John the Ripper. (In fact, the password is ridiculously easy to guess anyway)

```bash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt --rules passwd
Loaded 1 password hash (descrypt, traditional crypt(3) [DES 128/128 SSE2-16])
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
hello            (flag06)
1g 0:00:00:00 100% 100.0g/s 12800p/s 12800c/s 12800C/s 123456..diamond
```

And, easy as that, password is hello.

```bash
level06@nebula:~$ su flag06
Password: 
sh-4.2$ getflag
